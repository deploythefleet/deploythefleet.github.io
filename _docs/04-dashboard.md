The main dashboard contains an overview for the currently selected product. At a glance you can see what the default firmware version is, how many devices have come online, and how many different firmware versions are running in the field.

An important piece of data on the main dashboard is the update URL your devices will use to check for updates. It is found directly below the product name.
