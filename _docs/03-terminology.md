Deploy the Fleet is designed to get out of your way so you can seamlessly deliver awesome products to your customers. The terminology is pretty self-explanatory but here are some details.

## Product
A product is the top-level organizational unit in Deploy the Fleet. It represents a project or product and consists of a group of associated firmware binaries and devices running those binaries.

## Firmware
A firmware object in Deploy the Fleet consists of a firmware binary for your product devices as well as some metadata such as version number, size, hash, etc. Some of that metadata is automatically generated by the service and some is user customizable. A firmware object represents an update that your devices can receive from the service.

## Device
Device objects are automatically generated in Deploy the Fleet when your physical devices request firmware updates from the service. They consist of an ID and information about what firmware version they are currently running.

## OTA
Stands for Over-The-Air. OTA updates are very common in the IoT device industry as a way to deliver firmware updates over wireless protocols such as Bluetooth and WiFi.
