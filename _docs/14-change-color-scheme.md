Deploy the Fleet defaults to a dark theme. However, you can switch to a light theme if you prefer. 

  1. Click on your email displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. A menu will open.
  1. Click _Switch to Light Mode_

You can toggle back to Dark Mode following the same steps except you select _Switch to Dark Mode_ from the dropdown menu.
